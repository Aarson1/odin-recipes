    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.</p>
